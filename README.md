# Multithreaded Merge Sort in C using `pthreads`

This project demonstrates a comparison between a **standard (single-threaded)** merge sort and a **multithreaded merge sort** using the **POSIX threads (`pthread`)** library in C.

Multithreading helps optimize performance for large datasets by running recursive sort operations in parallel.

## Concept Overview

### Normal Merge Sort (Single Threaded)
The standard merge sort algorithm recursively calls the sort function for the left and right halves **sequentially in a single thread**.

### Multithreaded Merge Sort (Using `pthread`)

To speed up the process, we create **separate threads for sorting the left and right halves** of the array. Hereâ€™s how it works:

#### Step 1: Include the `pthread` Library
Use the POSIX Threads library to enable multithreading:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
```

#### Step 2: Create Threads

We define a structure to pass parameters like array pointer, left index, and right index into threads:

Then create threads for sorting each half:

#### Step 3: Thread Function

Each thread runs a recursive sort on its portion of the array:

#### Step 4: Join Threads

We use `pthread_join()` to ensure that one thread waits for another to finish execution. This is necessary to merge sorted subarrays safely.

## Threshold Optimization

To avoid unnecessary overhead from creating too many threads for small arrays, we define a **threshold size** (e.g., 5000 elements).  
- If the array size is **less than the threshold**, we perform normal merge sort.  
- If it is **greater**, we use multithreading to parallelize sorting.
